    review:
      'On the surface, the book is simply about an amateur whale hunter, who ocassionally joins whale hunts to find contemporary solace from their chaotic life. However, after carefully reading the book, the reader is bound to rethink the values taught by the bible (or any other religious text).',

    author: 'George Orwell',
    year: 1949,
    review:
      'Considered the apex of the books concerning Dystopia, George Orwell, on the offsets of the second world war, has been able to concieve this masterpiece. The book talks about an age where all the human beings are controlled and the state or government have achieved the power of gods. The beauty of this book is that, even in such a controlled world, Orwell strongly regards the human emotions in people.',

    name: 'To Kill a Mockingbird',
    author: 'Harper Lee',
    year: 1960,
    review:
      'I recently revisited "To Kill a Mockingbird", having read it as a child. I am delighted after having re-read the book as an adult, as I was able to see so much more perspective to the book. By demonstrating how a fair white lawyer risks his entire career and family to defend a black man who has been accused falsely of rape, the book takes the reader to the very depths of the prevalence and effects of racism during that time.',
